# Scala Dependency Injection

Testing out a few dependency injection techniques in scala. Main aims:

* Simple wiring
* Minimal boiler plate
* Compiler time, static checks
* No container, proxies, indirection, reflection or deep stacks 
* Dependencies easily mocked
* Coverage reports
* Will work naturally with [Play Framework][PlayFramework]

Cake Pattern based heavily on [Jonas Bonér's Real-World Scala: Dependency Injection (DI)][CakePattern]
